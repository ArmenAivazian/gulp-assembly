# 🏗 Gulp Assemblies

#### Project Status: `✅ Done`

**Gulp Assemblies** is a list of assemblies for gulp. These are my modifications for layout that I developed while working as a freelancer. These assemblies turn regular development code into a minified, ready-to-go project for deployment. The latest and most advanced one is in the folder `last-18-08-21`.
